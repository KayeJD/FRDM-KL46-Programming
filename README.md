# FRDM-KL46Z-Programming

A project folder featuring my projects involving programming a FRDM-KL46Z board using MCUXpresso. You can find the necessary files, configurations, and source code I used in developing these embedded systems applications in C. Here's a brief description of what you might find in such a project folder:

### Board Information:
1. Documentation or readme files describing the FRDM-KL46Z board, including its specifications, features, and peripherals.
2. Information about the MCU (Microcontroller Unit) on the board, such as the NXP Kinetis KL46 series MCU.

### MCUXpresso Project Files:
1. Configuration files generated by MCUXpresso, such as .project and .cproject files, which store project settings.
2. MCUXpresso SDK (Software Development Kit) files that include peripheral drivers, middleware, and example code for the FRDM-KL46Z.

### Source Code:
1 .C source code files (.c) containing the actual embedded application code. These files implement the logic and functionality of the projects.
